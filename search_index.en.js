Just stop their\ninstances once they are over budget.\n\nTrying it out\nSo as anyone would with a free service, you click about for a while.\nThe interesting parts I found about budgets (&amp; thus budget actions) is that you have them activate\non not just cost but some service usage, like S3 or EC2 CPU credits, which is\na super neat TIL.\nAt the end of my clicking I quickly got side tracked by the requirement of an\nIAM role to be use.\nThe humble default policy\nI feel like AWS knows IAM is pretty annoying when it provides you some\nsome defaults to copy &amp; paste into a new role.\nAnd here they are:\nDefault trust policy\n\nDefault permissions policy\n\nThoughts on these policy\nThe permissions are pretty broad &amp; could cause a lot of damage on their own.\nHaving the ability to attach policies to any of the three IAM principals is\nscreaming to be misused with some managed policies.\nThis policy is generated in the Console UI, so would be cool for them to tailor\nthe permissions to resources selected in the UI. Be a nice secure by default\noption &amp; leave the full example in the doc pages.\nThe saving grace is the trust policy only allowing the budgets service to use\nthe role.\nThat's enough IAM nerd snipping, they have their reasons.\nSpy vs. Spy time\nLike all good services in AWS that can mess with permissions, it might be good\nto do some threat modelling.\nNow, for todays session will be pitting against Red (Attackers) &amp; Blue (Defenders) teams.\n\n(this is not just me typing with different coloured LED lighting, I swear)\n\nSetting the scene\nTo set the scene for this cyber battle:\n\nSomeone read the aforementioned AWS blog post &amp; decided to give it a go, using the provided default role policies it worked &amp; then went along their day\nThe Red team in their wizardy ways have managed to get the AWS credentials\nof someone from Finance's Budgeting team that is reasonable scoped to the\nAWSBudgetsActionsWithAWSResourceControlAccess policy.\nThe Blue team are returning from their team lunch.\n\nThe Red Team has a few goals it is going for:\n\nElevating their own privilege\nDon't let any one stop their rampage\nTaking down the site\n\nThe Blue team wants none of that, but sometimes the best you can do is to know\nsomething is about.\nRed team: are going in with the attack\nWith their newly acquired Budget Team permissions they find scope at what they\ncan even do in the budget service. To their surprise they find this blog post\ntelling them exactly how to abuse these permissions!\nFortunately the budget service has this great way to apply IAM policies to\nroles at events &amp; SCPs to organization units (OU).\nElevating their own privilege\nFirst things first, get more permissions. Red Team wants it ALL.\nSomeone want to try out this new priv-esc (what the kewl h@ck0rz call it) they\nsaw using budgets. So they:\n\nDo the cloud whoami with the less succinct  aws sys get-caller-identity\nTake stock, enumerate what permissions you got (there are some cool scripts\nfor this like andresriancho/enumerate-iam)\n\nthe team learns they can list few things like IAM roles &amp; EC2\n\nmost importantly, listing IAM Roles includes trust policies\n\n\nthey also learn they got full access to budgets\nthey also discover the role setup for budget actions &amp; left unused for years\n\n\n\nPutting 1 and 1 together they came up with a plan of attack:\n\nMake a new budget that notifies at 1 S3 API call\nAdd a budget action to add the AdministratorAccess managed policy to their\nIAM principal\n???\nProfit\n\nNot long after laying the trap it springs &amp; they now got access to everything!\nThey are now free to do it all &amp; order the Snowmobile they always wanted.\nContinuing the rampage\nAt this point it is pretty game over, but just to keep going until the Blue\nTeam notices &amp; enjoying novelty of budget shinigans they keep going.\nNext, on the list from the blog post: service control policies\nSo taking their previous knowledge, listing the SCPs in the account:\n\nMake a new budget that notifies at 1 S3 API call\nAdd a budget action to add the DenyAll SCP that just happened to all the OUs\n???\nNo AWS services for anyone\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this will only work in the Organization root account\n\nTake down the site\nI think there is starting to be a pattern here... but this time targeting EC2 &amp;\nRDS instances.\nBONUS: Some things I didn't try cause it takes a billing cycle\nThe docs say it may remove the policy that is added by the alert.\nSo what happens if you add a policy that was already added?!\nFor example, targeting the default SCP policy to allow all services. Will that just get removed\nat the start of the next billing cycle.\nI know from experience that if you remove that one out you just turn AWS control\nplane off killing any serverless apps.\nBlue team: you activated my trap card!\nSince this service is behaving how it is suppose to &amp; seems pretty legitimate it\nis a bit hard to spot as it is happening. So I wouldn't blame them to be\nsurprised when the Snowmobile shows up.\nI doubt they'll get caught with the same trick twice though, looking back there\nare some tells that tell a tall tale.\nMonitoring &amp; Alerts\nThere are a few places the Blue team can put some monitors &amp; alerts on:\n\nevents relating to a human permissions\nevents for attaching some juicy managed policies, like AdministratorAccess or\nIAMFullAccess\nif budget events are infrequently changed, any event related to their\nchange\nor if you have a CI/CD deploying the actions, monitor for actions not by the\nCI/CD\nevents for old roles suddenly coming back to life\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list but some starting points.\nAlso worth pointing out these do not need to be paged on. No one likes\nnoisy alerts, they're often worse than nothing. So be careful tuning alerts.\nCleaning up old IAM roles\nThe previous role left was the keystone of the Red team's whole operation and\nit is the same story with like 90% of lateral movement maneuvers in AWS.\nCleaning up old unused IAM roles is really important, you never really know\n\nThe other 10% is over permissive IAM policies to make your own roles to\nmaneuver through.\n\nImplicit nice parts\nBy having to bring your own role (BYOR) for the service to use it does help mitigate\nmost of the potential of a Red Team's fun with this new feature.\nPlaying by your own rules\nFirst of all, your BYOR will be subject to your own SCPs in\nyour account. So if you already got good guardrails in your SCPs that prevent\nsilly things like attaching small managed policies like AdministratorAccess\nto a role then you'll be fine. If not, that might be a thing to look into.\nIt doesn't have AWS Organization magic\nCurrently there is no direct support from AWS Organization.\nWhich limits the scope that these can be applied on but does mean repetition\nacross a fleet of AWS accounts.\nThough, on the plus side it also means you can't pull an\nOrganization Cloudformation StackSet &amp; make a service-linked role with\nAdministratorAccess access all of the accounts with a click of a button\n(that is always a good time).\nIf this ever does integrate with Organization, this feature will get added to the\n\"why billing account access is scary list\".\nBlast radius\nIf the breach is not in the Organization root account, the damage is limited to\njust that account. That's with the assumption that accounts in a Organization stay\ncompleted separated, which is pretty generous.\nConclusion\nAs with most things AWS, the devil is in the IAM policy and what IAM Roles that\nget left around.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with this service or how it does about its\nmerry day, it is just in conjunction with people using AWS it can lead to a bad\ntime:tm:.\nMy Takeaways\nSome of my takeaways from writing this:\n\nUnused IAM Roles can be dangerous: so clean up after yourself\nMonitoring helps\nHave guardrails around juicy managed IAM policies, it may save you\nlater on\nNew features in older services can lead to interesting paths to\nAdministratorAccess, I would say read their announcement feeds but there\nis too much so see if anyone makes a blog about it\n\n","id":"https://blog.rnett.nz/posts/aws-budget-actions/","title":"Budgeting your way to Admin?"},"https://blog.rnett.nz/posts/aws-sso-deep-dive/":{"body":"\nWhat is even SSO?!\nSSO is the fancy TLA for Single Sign On, which is the great of idea\nof having just having to login into one place &amp; then authenticate into other\nservices when you want to.

Returns a\nlist of roles the token can use in said account\nsso:GetRoleCredentials - takes the access token, account id and role name.\nReturns working access keys for the role in said account.\n\nFor details about these actions have a look at the Boto3 docs for SSO service\nThese actions are recorded in CloudTrail.
